# Project Context

This project converts examples from "Grokking Algorithms" book into Python code.

## Book Chapters to Implement:
1. Binary Search
2. Selection Sort
3. Recursion
4. Quicksort
5. Hash Tables
6. Breadth-First Search
7. Dijkstra's Algorithm
8. Greedy Algorithms
9. Dynamic Programming
10. K-Nearest Neighbors

## Code Style:
- Each chapter = one folder
- Each concept = one Python file
- Include docstrings explaining the algorithm
- Add time/space complexity notes
- Include example usage
```
